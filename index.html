            <p style="text-align: justify;">The ranking of renewable energy sources in Australia from 1999 to 2023
              highlights significant shifts in the energy landscape. Hydro energy maintained its dominance throughout,
              but solar energy saw a sharp rise, overtaking other sources by 2020. Wind energy, after brief
              fluctuations, reclaimed a strong position, while bioenergy steadily declined. This reflects Australia's
              growing renewable output, with solar taking centre stage due to declining costs and widespread adoption.
              Bioenergy's decline suggests slower growth or less support compared to other technologies, offering
              insight into evolving priorities in Australia's renewable energy strategy.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">This visualisation highlights the dominance of fossil fuels, particularly
              black coal, in Australia's energy production mix from 1983 to 2023. Despite the rise of renewable
              energy, its share has remained relatively stagnant over the four decades. The most notable observation
              is the gradual increase in natural gas production, which began picking up around 2005 and has since
              become a more prominent part of the energy landscape. This suggests that while there have been efforts
              to diversify away from coal, particularly with a transition to cleaner fossil fuels like natural gas,
              the uptake of renewables has been slower than expected, with limited disruption to the fossil fuel
              dominance. Australia's reliance on coal, especially black coal, persists, pointing to structural
              challenges in shifting towards a more sustainable energy future despite global and national policy
              shifts aimed at reducing carbon emissions.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">This visualisation reveals a distinct contrast in energy consumption
          patterns across Australia. Regions with higher per capita energy consumption, like Western Australia and
          the Northern Territory, may reflect the influence of energy-intensive industries such as mining and
          resource extraction, or the infrastructure required to support dispersed populations in remote areas. In
          contrast, the relatively lower consumption in states like Victoria and New South Wales suggests that
          despite their larger populations, energy use per person remains more modest, potentially due to more
          efficient energy practices or a greater reliance on public services and transport infrastructure. These
          insights highlight the complex relationship between geography, industry, and energy efficiency,
          underscoring the need for tailored energy policies that address the specific demands of each region.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">The energy consumption trends across various sectors in Australia reveal a
          diverse distribution of energy demand. Transport and electricity sectors stand out with consistently high
          energy use, reflecting their integral roles in powering mobility and infrastructure. The steady rise in
          energy consumption within these sectors over time highlights the growing dependence on energy as
          urbanisation and industrialisation expand. Sectors like mining also show a notable increase, likely driven
          by Australia's resource extraction industries. In contrast, sectors such as commercial and other remain
          relatively flat, suggesting limited growth in energy needs within these areas.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">This visualisation highlights the substantial differences in energy
              flow
              metrics across non-renewable energy types—coal, natural gas, and oil—in Australia from 1973 to 2022.
              Coal dominates both production and export volumes, reflecting Australia’s strong position as a major
              exporter of coal. Natural gas shows a steady increase in exports over time, pointing to its rising
              importance in international energy markets. In contrast, oil is characterised by higher levels of
              imports compared to domestic production, underscoring Australia's reliance on external sources to
              meet
              its oil consumption needs. The contrast between high production and export values, particularly for
              coal and natural gas, and low import figures illustrates Australia's role as a net energy exporter
              in
              non-renewables. This energy flow profile offers insight into the country’s evolving energy strategy
              and the global demand for its energy resources.</p>

              and oil in Australia from 1973 to 2022. Each line represents a<br>single year during that period. The
              vertical axis shows energy values in petajoules, while the horizontal axis covers four key
              energy flow metrics: production, consumption, import, and export. To interpret the chart, follow a line
              from left to right to see how each energy type's energy flows
              through the system for a given year. For example, a line starting high on the left and dipping toward
              the right suggests<br>a high level of production but lower consumption or exports.</p>

              states/territories: NSW - New South Wales | VIC - Victoria | QLD - Queensland | WA - Western
              Australia | SA - South Australia | TAS - Tasmania | NT - Northern Territory</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This chart highlights that coal and gas dominate Australia's energy
              consumption across most states, but there are notable variations. For instance, NSW and Queensland
              show a significant reliance on coal, with little diversification into renewables. Western Australia
              and South Australia, on the other hand, have a more balanced consumption of gas and oil, although
              coal still plays a role. States like Tasmania<br>and South Australia have more renewables in their mix,
              indicating a stronger push towards clean energy compared to the eastern states. However, renewables
              overall still constitute a small portion of the national energy consumption mix, suggesting that
              despite Australia’s efforts to increase renewable energy sources, fossil fuels, particularly coal
              and gas, remain entrenched in the energy landscape. This uneven distribution reflects regional
              variations in resource availability, energy policies, and the pace of transition to cleaner energy
              sources.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Despite having smaller populations than Victoria, QLD and WA
              consume more energy than Australia's second largest state by population.</p>
